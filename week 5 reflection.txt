Fox (Jin) Seo5/1/20Things Accomplished:-Finished 3 handouts from my STA 100 class-Set up a repository in GitHub: https://github.com/fox-aka-jin/R-stuffObstacles This Week:-None I can think of.Things Planned for Next Week:-I want to make a guide soon on how to set up a repository in GitHub for our lab. It’s not too difficult, and the GitHub desktop application does come with a tutorial, but I think it would be helpful to make a step-by-step guide on how/why people use GitHub, and the advantages of using it.

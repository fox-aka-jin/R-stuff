I figure I can knock out 2 birds in one stone by doing both my coding practice and MCB 123 HW today in one exercise.

I need to make an activity curve for [NADH] using some provided data.

Steps taken:
1) convert excel data spreadsheet into a .csv file (R Studio only seems to like .csv, rather than .txt)
  -my data spreadsheet was saved as "hw2table3"
  -weirdly enough, importing my data gave me 3 extra rows of data. I dealt with that by simply telling R to use the data in rows 1 to 9
  
2) Used google to determine the equation I need to use
  -determined that it's best to use a non-linear regression
  
3) General form of non-linear regression:
  lines(x, fitted(line), lty = 2, col = "black", lwd = 1)
    -these are the properties of the line
  line = nls(y~vmax*x/(km+x))
    -nls: the function for a non-linear regression, the stuff we put inside are the equation we use for the linreg
    
4) Confirmed that the line fits our data well through R.square
  RSS = sum(residuals(line)^2)
  TSS = sum((y - mean(y))^2)
  R.square = 1 - (RSS/TSS)
  R.square


```{r}

x = hw2table3$X.NADH...µM[1:9]
y = hw2table3$Average.Velocity[1:9]

enz1table = plot(hw2table3$X.NADH...µM., hw2table3$Average.Velocity, main = "Enzyme 1 Velocity vs. [NADH]", xlab = "[NADH] (µM)", ylab = "Average Velocity (Units)")
lines(x, fitted(line), lty = 2, col = "black", lwd = 1)
line = nls(y~vmax*x/(km+x))
line

RSS = sum(residuals(line)^2)
TSS = sum((y - mean(y))^2)
R.square = 1 - (RSS/TSS)
R.square
```

We repeat for Enzyme 2

```{r}
x2 = hw2table4$X.NADH...µM[1:9]
y2 = hw2table4$Average.Velocity[1:9]

enz2table = plot(hw2table4$X.NADH...µM., hw2table4$Average.Velocity, main = "Enzyme 2 Velocity vs. [NADH]", xlab = "[NADH] (µM)", ylab = "Average Velocity (Units)")
lines(x2, fitted(line), lty = 2, col = "black", lwd = 1)
line = nls(y2~vmax*x2/(km+x2))
line

RSS = sum(residuals(line)^2)
TSS = sum((y - mean(y))^2)
R.square = 1 - (RSS/TSS)
R.square

```

Today I'll work on the last and final worksheet from my STA 100 class. Next week, I plan to learn how to do Differential Expression Analysis.


```{r}

#we'll be using data built into R for cats
library("MASS")
head(cats)

names(cats)
#our column names are Sex, Bwt and Hwt

#let's make a plot:
plot(cats$Bwt,cats$Hwt,xlab = "Body Weight", ylab = "Heart Weight",main = "Relationship Between Body and Heart Weight")

#NEXT, we NEED to remove Outliers!
#to do so, we will take the following steps:
#1: figure out quantiles
  Q1Hwt = quantile(cats$Hwt,0.25)
  Q3Hwt = quantile(cats$Hwt,0.75)
  Q1Bwt = quantile(cats$Bwt,0.25)
  Q3Bwt = quantile(cats$Bwt,0.75)
  
#2: determine the bounds of our quantiles
  lowerboundHwt = Q1 - 1.5*(Q3Hwt-Q1Hwt)
  upperboundHwt = Q3 + 1.5*(Q3Hwt-Q1Hwt)
  lowerboundBwt = Q1 - 1.5*(Q3Bwt-Q1Bwt)
  upperboundBwt = Q3 + 1.5*(Q3Bwt-Q1Bwt)
  
#3: kick out the outliers
  outliersHwt = which(cats$Hwt > upperboundHwt | cats$Hwt < lowerboundHwt)
  outliersBwt = which(cats$Bwt > upperboundBwt | cats$Bwt < lowerboundBwt)
  
  data.no.outliers = cats[-c(outliersHwt,outliersBwt),]
  data.no.outliers
  
  
#let's try plotting again:
  plot(data.no.outliers$Bwt, data.no.outliers$Hwt, xlab = "Body Weight", ylab = "Heart Weight",main = "Relationship Between Body and Heart Weight")
  
#to plot the regression line:
  #use function lm, which means "linear model"
  lin.model = lm(Hwt ~ Bwt,data = data.no.outliers)
  the.betas = lin.model$coefficients
  s.e = summary(lin.model)$sigma
  r.2 =summary(lin.model)$r.squared 
```
